Classic Farm CMS

Made a small CMS originally for a automobile-type busniess. 

Allows you to create, read from, add to, and delete subjects, pages with those subjects, and items with those pages.

An example would be a Subject of Cars, a Page of Cars for Sale, and an item of Honda Accord.

This CMS is very easily customizable as well and can be used for a wide variety of purposes including a simple business Web site
with the common Staff, History, Purpose or it can be pretty complex.
